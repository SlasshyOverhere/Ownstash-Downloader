# Gemini Shortlist: High-Confidence Quick Wins

These are the features I am most confident in implementing quickly and with high quality. They rely on existing capabilities of our underlying tools (`yt-dlp`, Tauri) or standard frontend logic, minimizing the risk of architectural blockers.

## 1. SponsorBlock Integration (⛔ Ad Removal)
**Description:** Automatically remove sponsored segments, intros, outros, and subscription reminders from YouTube videos.
**Why:** This is a "killer" feature that significantly improves the consumption experience. It leverages functionality already built into `yt-dlp`.
**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Frontend:** Add a toggle switch "Remove Sponsors/Intermissions" in the `MediaInfoModal` and `SettingsPage` (for a global default).
- **Backend (Rust):** Update the `DownloadRequest` struct to include a `use_sponsorblock` boolean. In `downloader.rs`, if this flag is true, append the argument `--sponsorblock-remove all` to the `yt-dlp` command.
**Confidence:** **10/10**. It acts as a simple pass-through flag to the underlying engine.

## 2. Clipboard Monitor (📋 Auto-Detect Links)
**Description:** A persistent toggle that monitors the system clipboard. When a supported URL is copied, the app automatically notifies the user or pre-fills the input.
**Why:** Drastically reduces user friction. The "Copy -> Switch Window -> Paste -> Click Fetch" loop is tedious.
**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Frontend:** Use the `tauri-plugin-clipboard-manager` (or simple window focus polling if we want to stay lightweight) to check clipboard content.
- **Logic:** Reuse the existing regex patterns in `HomePage.tsx` to validate the clipboard text. If it matches, show a `sonner` toast with a "Download Now" action button.
**Confidence:** **9/10**. Tauri provides robust clipboard access APIs.

## 3. Custom Filename Formatting (📝 File Organization)
**Description:** Allow users to define how output files are named (e.g., "Artist - Title [1080p]" vs "Title only").
**Why:** Power users and data hoarders have specific naming conventions for their libraries (Plex/Jellyfin compatibility).
**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Frontend:** Add a "Filename Template" input in `SettingsPage`. Provide a cheat sheet of available variables (e.g., `%(title)s`, `%(uploader)s`, `%(upload_date)s`).
- **Backend (Rust):** Retrieve this setting string. In `downloader.rs`, replace the hardcoded output template `%(title)s.%(ext)s` with the user's custom string passed to the `-o` flag.
**Confidence:** **10/10**. `yt-dlp` has an extremely flexible output template engine that we just need to expose.

## 4. System Tray & "Minimize to Tray" (🔽 Background Mode)
**Description:** Allow the app to keep running and downloading even when the main window is closed.
**Why:** Large downloads (4K movies, playlists) take time. Users shouldn't have to keep a large window open on their desktop.
**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Backend (Rust):** Configure the `SystemTray` in `main.rs`. Add menu items for "Show", "Hide", and "Quit".
- **Event Handling:** Intercept the window's `CloseRequested` event. If the "Minimize to Tray" setting is enabled, cancel the close event and `window.hide()` instead.
**Confidence:** **9/10**. This is a standard feature of the Tauri framework.

## 5. Proxy Support (🌍 Region Unlocking)
**Description:** Route downloads through a HTTP/SOCKS proxy.
**Why:** Essential for downloading content that is geoblocked (e.g., BBC iPlayer, region-specific YouTube videos).
**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Frontend:** Add "Proxy URL" field in `SettingsPage`.
- **Backend (Rust):** Read this setting. If present, pass the `--proxy <url>` argument to `yt-dlp`.
**Confidence:** **10/10**. `yt-dlp` natively handles proxy connections, so we don't need to implement complex networking code.
