# Google OAuth Client ID (for browser-based Google Sign-in)
# To find it:
# 1. Go to Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials
# 2. Find "Web client (auto created by Google Service)" under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
# 3. Copy the Client ID (ends with .apps.googleusercontent.com)
# 4. Add your redirect URIs to "Authorized redirect URIs":
#    - http://localhost:1420 (for development)
#    - Your hosted callback page URL (for production)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# OAuth Redirect URI for PRODUCTION builds
# In development, localhost:1420 is used automatically.
# For production, you MUST host the oauth-callback.html file and set this URL.
# Example: https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/oauth-callback.html
# Also add this URL to Google Cloud Console's Authorized redirect URIs!
